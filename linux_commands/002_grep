# >>>>>>>>> GREP TUT: Global Regular Expression Print <<<<<<<<<<<<<

it allows us to search for text within files in our system

## look for version of grep in our system:
grep -V

## Homebrew is a package manager for the mac

## Find "hq2nguye" in a file (PARTIAL match)
grep "hq2nguye" text_file.txt

this will return: hq2nguye, hq2nguye@uwaterloo

## EXACT MATCH
grep -w "hq2nguye" text_file.txt

return exactly: hq2nguye

**Note:** grep is case sensitive

## NON-CASE SENSITIVE MATCH
grep -wi "hq2nguye" text_file.txt

return: hq2nguye, HQ2NGUYE

## LOOK FOR THE LINE NUMBER WHERE WE FOUND THE MATCH
grep -win "hq2nguye" text_file.txt

## SEE SOME CONTEXT BEFORE (-B) & AFTER (-A) THE MATCH
To see 4 lines before or after the match context:

grep -win -B (or -A) 4 "hq2nguye" text_file.txt

## SEE BOTH BEFORE AND AFTER (-C)

grep -win -C 4 "hq2nguye" text_file.txt

## Search the match for every file in the current directory

grep -win "hq2nguye" ./*
grep -win "hq2nguye" ./*.txt

**Note:** This does not search the context in subdirectory

## RECURSIVE SEARCH (-r) IN CURRENT DIRECOTRY AS WEL AS SUBDIRECTORY

We can specify a directory as a starting point:

grep -winr "hq2nguye" text_file.txt .

**Note** If the directory is a big directory then it may take extremely long

## ONLY return the FILES which contain the matched context (-l)
grep -wirl "hq2nguye" text_file.txt

## ONLY return the FILES WITH NUMBER OF MATCHES which contain the matched context (-c)
grep -wirc "hq2nguye" text_file.txt

this will count number of file

# >>>>>> SEARCH FOR HISTORY OF THE LATEST GIT COMMAND <<<<<<<

## one way to do it is:
history

this will display all history

## NARROW DOWN HISTORY: grep for specific command
history | grep "git commit"

## NARROW DOWN FURTHER TO FILE SPECIFIC
history | grep "git commit" | grep "erindale"

# >>>>>>>>> COMBINE WITH REGREX <<<<<<<<<<<<<<

**NOTE:** grep uses Posix Regex by default whereas python Pearl compatible regex so this may affect our search result

## Search for phone number with format: ***-***-****
grep "...-...-...." telephone_file.txt
