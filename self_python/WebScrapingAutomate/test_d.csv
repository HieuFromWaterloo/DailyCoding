Celadon Group,NA,"January 23, 2020",Bankruptcy,NA,KSV Advisory,NA,NA,NA,Transportation,NA,"Celadon Group, a significant American truckload shipping company, had its US Chapter 11 bankruptcy recognized in Canada on January 23 and a receiver was appointed to oversee the liquidation of the assets of Celadon Group's sole Canadian business, Hyndman Transport. On December 9, 2019, Celadon Group and its 25 subsidiaries (collectively, the ""Chapter 11 Debtors"") filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and ceased operations. During the summer of 2019, the decline in overall freight tonnage and excessive truck capacity led to a significant decline in freight rates and a corresponding decline in the Chapter 11 Debtors' liquidity. The Chapter 11 Debtors' principal secured creditors include MidCap Financial Trust, Blue Torch Finance, and Luminus Energy Partners Master Fund. Upon discontinuation of its business, Hyndman terminated nearly all of its workforce and purportedly owes former employees approximately $2.3 million. The appointment of a receiver will allow these employees to claim and receive statutory payments, including for unpaid wages and termination pay. Blue Torch Finance will be providing DIP financing during these proceedings. KSV Advisory was appointed receiver. Counsel is DLA Piper for the Chapter 11 Debtors and Celadon Group (as the foreign representative), Bennett Jones for the receiver, McMillan for Blue Torch Finance, Norton Rose Fulbright for MidCap Financial Trust, and Koskie Minsky for 200 former Hyndman employees."

ATB had advanced funds to the companies pursuant to various commitment letters. The companies committed several defaults under these letters, and since May 2019, ATB has been negotiating with them to enter a forbearance agreement. However, the parties were unable to agree to the agreement prior to the clinics ceasing operations, and subsequent events led ATB to conclude that it was not prepared to provide further funding to the companies to continue the operation of their clinics. ATB was advised by the companies that they had removed $2.0 million from the business to be invested in real estate ventures, including a quadplex in Calgary and a failed development in Nigeria. When ATB asked for the details of these transactions to be provided as part of the proposed forbearance agreement, the companies failed to do so. These transactions caused ATB serious concern and were one of the primary causes of the companies' liquidity issues. EY was appointed receiver. MLT Aikins is counsel to the applicant."

Cost overruns in preparing this new facility, re-location costs, operational issues on start-up, and the conclusion of a major contract all negatively impacted the company's financial position. In September 2019, Sle-Co Properties entered into an agreement of purchase and sale for the sale of the St. Thomas property to a third party, to be leased back to the company on certain conditions. The agreement eventually lapsed and the two companies were unable to obtain re-financing. On November 5, the company filed an NOI and BDO was appointed proposal trustee. The companies attempted to restructure their affairs through the sale of all or a portion of their assets, including the St. Thomas property. Based on the outcome of this sales process, the company determined it would not be able to file a viable proposal.

Morris Industries is the primary operating company and manufactures air carts, drills, seeders, and bale carriers. In recent years, the Morris Group has incurred significant losses due to several factors: the introduction of a new product line that experienced warranty issues which required a significant capital investment beyond foreseeable estimates; the Group's increased costs were accompanied by decreasing sales; and, as a result of declining financial results, the Group lost access to a factoring facility that had previously provided for the early payment of a substantial portion of its accounts receivable. Currently, each of the companies is unable to meet its obligations as they become due and is facing an imminent liquidity crisis.

George Gosbee, who passed away in November 2017, was the company's sole director, officer, and shareholder. Karen Gosbee, his spouse, is the personal representative of Mr. Gosbee's estate. On January 7, PwC filed an application for an order declaring, amongst other things, that certain transactions granted by the company in favour of BNS (collectively, the ""BNS Transaction"") constitute a transfer at undervalue and are void as against the trustee. Bowfort, the company's primary creditor, had provided to the company a loan of USD $5.0 million secured by a promissory note dated January 2014. This loan was advanced to the company to assist in funding its USD $7.5 million investment in a US business venture. The company did not make any repayments of the loan to Bowfort other than certain baseline annual interest payments. On August 10, 2017, the Gosbees entered into a commitment letter with BNS to open a private and personal overdraft lending account. At their direction, the company completed a series of transfers whereby USD $750.0 thousand belonging to the company was transferred into this personal account, to the detriment of the company's creditors. At the time the BNS Transaction was completed, the company was insolvent. It is alleged that there was no valid business purpose for the company entering the BNS Transaction, and by doing so, it breached its obligation to Bowfort.

In February 2019 it was determined that additional funds of approximately $375.0 million were required to complete construction of the mine and processing plant. Significant efforts were undertaken to find investors, buyers or partners but to date no binding agreements have been reached.

The group has also defaulted on substantially all of its obligations to its lenders. Since October 2018, the company has entered into multiple forbearance agreements with its lenders, the most recent of which expired on December 20. 2019.

Previously known as Fortress Paper, the company changed its name in 2018 to reflect its intention to shift away from traditional pulp and paper operations and pursue opportunities in new business segments. The majority of the company's revenues is now derived from the production and sale of dissolving pulp, a product with a variety of commercial applications, including the production of rayon textile fibres. The market for dissolving pulp, however, has not been favourable for the company, with prices dropping from almost $950 USD per ton in 2017 to $640 USD per ton this year. Other factors have also contributed to the company's financial difficulties, including the recent Sino-American economic conflict which is disrupting markets and the garment sector which Fortress serves. In the past three years, the company has lost approximately $246.6 million. In consultation with its senior secured lenders, the company launched a sale and investment solicitation process in August 2019 with the assistance of Houlihan Lokey but to date has failed to receive any indications of interest. With no liquidity to operate in the normal course, the company's senior secured lenders, Investissement Québec (IQ) and Fiera, made an application on the company's behalf for creditor protection. While under creditor protection, it is anticipated that the company's pulp mill will be indefinitely idled while the company waits for market conditions to improve. Concurrently, the company will explore other ways to return to profitability, including potentially modernizing and upgrading its current facilities with the assistance of a new investor.

On December 11, the company's CEO and chairman of the board, Viraf Kapadia, attempted to access the company premises but his key card no longer worked. His access was then physically barred by one of the dissident shareholders. It appears as though the dissident shareholders seized the company in reliance of a meeting of shareholders held at 8 am in which the board was purportedly replaced.

The companies' request to be granted creditor protection past the initial 10-day stay was opposed by the applicants in part on the basis that they no longer had confidence in the management of the companies and wanted a receiver appointed to safely manage and preserve the properties, ensure rents are collected and not co-mingled amongst the various companies and ensure operational expenses are paid by the appropriate companies.

The company has attributed its financial difficulties to the extended slump in the Canadian energy market. Vacancy rates in commercial office space in Calgary have soared since 2015 due to companies ceasing operations, engaging in headcount reductions and undertaking cost cutting measures. These vacancies have been compounded in the last two years by a large amount of new office space being added to the Calgary market, as well as increases in the property taxes being charged by the city. To put things in perspective, Calgary's downtown office vacancy rate is estimated to be 24.6% vs. Toronto's 2.2%. These changing market conditions have reduced the company's revenues and materially reduced the market value of many of its rental assets.
