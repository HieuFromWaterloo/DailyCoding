On December 9, 2019, Celadon Group and its 25 subsidiaries (collectively, the ""Chapter 11 Debtors"") filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and ceased operations. During the summer of 2019, the decline in overall freight tonnage and excessive truck capacity led to a significant decline in freight rates and a corresponding decline in the Chapter 11 Debtors' liquidity. The Chapter 11 Debtors' principal secured creditors include MidCap Financial Trust, Blue Torch Finance, and Luminus Energy Partners Master Fund. Upon discontinuation of its business, Hyndman terminated nearly all of its workforce and purportedly owes former employees approximately $2.3 million. The appointment of a receiver will allow these employees to claim and receive statutory payments, including for unpaid wages and termination pay. Blue Torch Finance will be providing DIP financing during these proceedings. KSV Advisory was appointed receiver.

As a result of these financial challenges, the Schurman Group fell behind on payments to American Greetings, and American Greetings terminated their agreements in December 2019.

The majority of the company's revenues is now derived from the production and sale of dissolving pulp, a product with a variety of commercial applications, including the production of rayon textile fibres. The market for dissolving pulp, however, has not been favourable for the company, with prices dropping from almost $950 USD per ton in 2017 to $640 USD per ton this year. Other factors have also contributed to the company's financial difficulties, including the recent Sino-American economic conflict which is disrupting markets and the garment sector which Fortress serves.

The reduction in international sales, coupled with a highly leveraged balance sheet, has left the company without the working capital necessary to fund operations and service its debt.

Xela has repeatedly refused to answer questions about the operations of its subsidiaries, though there is no dispute that it indirectly owns shares in what is considered one of Central America's largest poultry producers. These shares are estimated to be worth millions of dollars, but the business is ensnared in litigation with other family members in Guatemala (the ""Cousins""). The receivership order was granted over a competing CCAA application by Xela, which argued that it was insolvent as a result of, among other things, the Cousins' withholding of hundreds of millions of dollars of dividends from the poultry business.

The AER had been in discussions with the company since February 2019 regarding its financial difficulties as well as a potential debtor-led restructuring of the company's business and operations. On April 29, the company advised the AER that it may be unable to continue operations at its licensed sites. The AER responded by issuing an order directing the company to address end-of-life obligations associated with 4,400 energy licensed sites, either by decommissioning those sites, posting financial security or transferring the sites to responsible energy companies. With no funds to even enter into creditor protection, the company ceased operations the next day, terminating its 33 employees and 61 contractors and leaving its wells to the care of the AER, including proximately 1,500 wells that were not shut-in and continue to produce. It is estimated that the company's abandonment and reclamation obligations total approximately $329.0MM. The company also owes its secured lenders an additional $90.0MM and has unpaid property taxes of over $2.0MM. In the interest of public safety, the Orphan Well Association applied for a receiver to be appointed to ensure that the company's wells are properly cared for and maintained and shut-in where necessary. The Orphan Well Association is also hoping that, where possible, wells and other oil and gas assets can be sold to responsible producers to avoid having further assets designated as orphan wells.

These funds, which are worth approximately $5.2MM, were recovered by the OSC relating to investment schemes by the two companies. Between May 2004 and October 2008, various companies were found to have violated the Ontario Securities Act in raising about $180.0MM from investors. Other than two respondents who entered into approved settlement agreements, the OSC concluded that the remaining companies had violated the Act by, amongst other things, (1) trading in securities without registration and filing a prospectus; and (2) engaging in a course of conduct they knew or ought to have known would perpetrate a fraud on investors. In a sanctions decision released in 2014, an OSC panel ordered that the companies fully disgorge certain amounts, some on a joint and several basis with York Rio and Brilliante.

The company has been significantly impacted by the ongoing financial downturn affecting the oil and gas industry in Canada. This decrease in revenue, coupled with legacy administrative overheads, has placed significant stress on the company's cash flow. As a result, the company has needed to raise significant amounts of capital to fund the business losses, placing the company at a competitive disadvantage. The holders of secured loans that had been funding the company to continue its operations are no longer willing to provide further funding without a restructuring. Through these CCAA proceedings, the company expects to secure commitments for up to an aggregate amount of $1.5MM in DIP financing from certain of its directors, officers and existing shareholders.

Since cannabis is a regulated product, the company's ability to generate revenue is largely dependent on its holding the necessary licences. In September 2018, Health Canada partially suspended the company's cannabis licences, which are held by its subsidiary Agrima Botanicals, as a result of Agrima's failure to meet certain compliance requirements. In November 2018, Health Canada further notified Agrima of its intention to revoke its licences for alleged contraventions of the Cannabis Act. Due to Health Canada's suspension and proposed revocation of the company's cannabis licences, the company is no longer able to legally produce or distribute cannabis in Canada. This has decimated the company's ability to generate positive cash flow, and is the primary cause of its financial difficulties and corresponding insolvency. In addition, the suspension and proposed revocation of the licences has made it virtually impossible for the company to raise money through the capital markets to resolve its liquidity problems. The company engaged Clarus Securities to assist it in conducting a sale and investment solicitation process for its business. Although the company was ultimately unable to conclude a sale transaction, a number of potential purchasers remain interested. EY was appointed monitor.

Hutchens et al.,NA,"February 28, 2019",Interim Receivership,NA,Farber,Naymark Law,Gary Stevens,Necpal Litigation,Other,Alberta,"Hutchens et al., a group of individuals who allegedly orchestrated a fraudulent loan scheme, was placed in interim receivership on February 28 on application by Gary Stevens, Linda Stevens and 1174365 Alberta (""117 Alberta"") (collectively, the ""Applicants""). Gary and Linda, residents of Alberta, are the sole shareholders of 117 Alberta. The Applicants sought a receivership order to protect their ability to enforce two final judgments against Tanya Hutchens and Sandy Hutchens from a US federal court in Pennsylvania. The Applicants were defrauded by the Respondents in a fraudulent scheme disguised as a financing enterprise for real estate transactions. In October 2014, the Applicants sought refinancing for mortgage loans on property they were developing in Saskatchewan. They were referred to Westmoreland Equity Fund, which required the Applicants to pay large advance fees for the financing they sought. Over the following months, Westmoreland reneged on its promises to provide financing, changing the amount it said it would loan from $13.9MM (CAD) to $7.5MM (CAD), on conditions Westmoreland knew the Applicants could not meet. The Applicants realized that Westmoreland was the front for a fraudulent scheme orchestrated by the Hutchenses. Westmoreland would first issue loan commitments that it could neither fund nor intended to. Then, it would create a pretext to find fault with the borrowers' loan applications, which it used to justify imposing further monetary conditions. Finally, Westmoreland would assert its victims had not satisfied these new conditions in order to terminate the loan application process, after which Westmoreland would keep all the monies advanced. The Applicants brought a claim against Westmoreland and the Hutchenses in the Pennsylvania State Court because the company was registered as operating in Pennsylvania.

Several key factors have resulted in the company having constrained working capital, including the recent volatility of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil prices, the effect of mandated hedging programs, the softening of the Canadian dollar, the deteriorating differential price for Canadian-produced crude oil, and temporary operational challenges. Finally, the company has limited access to necessary cash flow for reinvestment due to its significant monthly payments to NBC.

Thus far, it has received a number of letters of intent which offer consideration sufficient to repay NBC in full, pay all of the company's liabilities, as well as provide value to the group's shareholders. The company currently requires a stay of proceedings in order to, amongst other things, provide the company with enough time to run a comprehensive and transparent sale and investment solicitation process.

The Payless Canada entities owe approximately $156.7MM (USD) under an ABL Credit Facility to which they are guarantors. Coinciding with the commencement of the CCAA proceedings in Canada, certain affiliates of the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the US. Payless Holdings and other subsidiaries (the ""Payless Group"") had previously filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2017. The Payless Group also applied to the Ontario Superior Court of Justice as the foreign representative. Both the Canadian court and the US Bankruptcy Court approved a reorganization, which was effective as of August 2017. Despite these proceedings, the Payless Group has been unable to sustain profitable operations in the current retail environment. Although the Group sought to deleverage their balance sheet and implement cost-reduction by downsizing their corporate offices, terminating various employees and reducing their capital expenditures plan, its North American brick and mortar business continues to experience top-line sales decline. Despite efforts to negotiate with Payless Group's pre-petition lenders for additional credit, the Payless Canada entities have been unable to return to profitability, reporting a net operating loss of more than $12.0MM (USD) in 2018. As a result of the financial difficulties suffered, the Payless Canada entities are insolvent and unable to meet their liabilities as they become due.

However, following the execution of the agreement, Thor became aware of certain long-standing financial irregularities in the North American entity's books and records. As a result, the parties amended the agreement to exclude the North American entities from the scope of the Thor Transaction. Subsequently, Erwin Hymer Global Group's parent company, EHG SE, divested its ownership interests in the North American entity to Corner Flag, a special purpose Delaware limited liability company that was formed to acquire these ownership interests. Since January and the discovery of the financial irregularities in the company's financial reporting, the company has been experiencing significant operational, liquidity and governance challenges, which have rendered it unable to continue operating in the normal course.

The two companies are part of a large global group of privately owned companies operating four rod mills in the aluminum sector. In 2014, this group acquired the Becancour plant from Alcoa Canada and entered into a 10-year supply contract with it to provide SLPC with 100,000 metric tons per year of molten aluminum. SQ has experienced higher losses than forecast primarily because of schedule delays caused by, amongst other things, the death of a worker and construction cost overruns. The problems experienced by SQ impacted the SLPC operations. Furthermore, in fall 2018, Alcoa informed SLPC that its molten metal production would no longer be sufficient to meet SLPC's demand. Compounding these existing issues, the US announced in May 2018 that tariffs of 25% on imports of Canadian steel and 10% imports of Canadian aluminum would take effect on June 1, 2018. These tariffs significantly increased working capital pressures on the group as it scrambled to negotiate price concessions with its metal supplier and price premiums with its clients. By February 2019, SLPC's indebtedness to Alcoa increased to approximately $40.0MM, and it sent the company a notice requesting payment. PwC was appointed monitor.

The QCX Platform was launched in December 2013 and is used to facilitate the purchase and sale of cryptocurrencies for the company's 363,000 registered users. A user who wants to transfer bitcoin or other cryptocurrency requires a wallet. A wallet has an address to each user and is comparable to a piggybank that is located on a user's phone or computer. Wallets are described as either hot or cold. A hot wallet is located on a server and is used for transactions that require a quicker turnaround. A cold wallet or cold storage is located offline and is a safe space to secure coins. Any coins credited to a user on the platform were stored by Quadriga, either in a hot or cold wallet. Only a minimal amount of coins were kept on the server in a hot wallet. The normal procedure was to move the coins to a cold storage as a way to protect the coins from hacking or other virtual theft. The company cites several factors for its financial difficulties and current liquidity crisis. First, the company notes that it was never able to obtain a corporate bank account because the banks did not want to deal with it because of the cryptocurrency business. The company therefore had to use personal bank accounts and third party payment processors. In January 2018, CIBC froze an account that held approximately $25.7MM being held on Quidriga's behalf. The funds were paid into court and eventually released, but Quadriga has been unable to find a banking institution to accept the bank drafts. More recently, in December 2018, Gerry Cotten, Quadriga's founder and sole officer and director, passed away unexpectedly at the age of 30 while in India. Gerry ran the business through his laptop, which is encrypted and password protected. To date, and despite many expert attempts, no one has been been able to hack into the computer. Of critical concern is that an estimated $180.0MM of coins which Gerry moved to cold storage will essentially be lost, as Gerry alone held the security keys for the location of the cold wallets. The decision to enter bankruptcy protection was made to allow the company breathing room to investigate whatever stores of cryptocurrency may be available and negotiate the bank drafts available to the company. The proceedings will also stay any potential legal actions that users may have commenced had they been unable to access their funds. The company is also exploring the potential sale of its operating platform, which may have significant value and could lead to value being realized for the benefit of the company's creditors.

Established in 1988, the company is the primary provider of hydroformed components to the Fiat Chrysler Automative business (""FCA"") on certain Dodge Ram and Jeep lines. It is the only Canadian-based operating subsidiary in the Vari-Form Group's hydroforming business. In early 2018, the company began experiencing serious financial difficulties. It attempted to launch several new programs, including ones that used a new type of steel that significantly increased the burden on the company's equipment and processes. Due to engineering and mechanical challenges arising from the new steel, as well as unplanned downtime, management hired supplemental employees and funded significant cost overruns to protect customer schedules. As a result, the company incurred millions of dollars in excess program launch costs, which severely strained its liquidity. Despite widespread efforts over the recent months to resolve operational issues and reduce costs, including negotiations with its secured lenders, key customers and other stakeholders, the company has been unable to negotiate a sustainable solution. In November 2018, the company and its related companies retained Angle Advisors - a US-based investment banking firm - to conduct a marketing and sale process for their businesses. Based on recent cash flow statements, the company estimates that its operations are sustaining a cash burn of more than $1.0MM per week. Because the company is insolvent and unable to meet its liabilities as they become due, it requires the protections of the CCAA to obtain the liquidity needed to maintain operations while pursuing the going concern sale of its business on an expedited basis. 11032569 Canada, which is an affiliate of FCA and the proposed DIP lender, has entered into a stalking horse APA.

The company has no significant assets other than certain contracts relating to the St. Michael's Hospital Redevelopment Project. Due to various defaults committed by Bondfield, the contractor, there have been delays in the construction of this project, which involves building a new 17-storey patient-care tower at the corner of Queen and Victoria Streets in Toronto, Ontario. In addition, there are a number of construction liens registered on the project site, and as a result of Bondfield's financial challenges, the project has effectively come to a halt. Notwithstanding these default events, the company has not taken any steps to declare Bondfield in default under their construction contract or to make demand under the performance bond. In November 2018, the hospital delivered a default notice. With the hospital's support, BMO has been attempting to work consensually with Zurich Insurance, the project's surety, to restart and complete the project. However, BMO has been advised by Zurich that it cannot make demand on the performance bond unless it first ""steps in"" to the project, a step which may create additional liability for the lenders.

The company has no significant assets other than relevant contracts relating to the development, construction and completion of the Hawkesbury & District General Hospital Redevelopment Project. Due to various defaults committed by Bondfield, the contractor, there have been delays and cost overruns in the construction of this project, which involves expanding the emergency department, constructing a new family birthing centre, and renovating the existing hospital to accommodate a new psychiatry in-patient unit. Notwithstanding the various default events by Bondfield, the company has not taken any steps to declare Bondfield in default, to seek performance by Bondfield, or to make demand under the performance bond. In September 10, 2018, the hospital delivered a default notice that triggered a 120-day period, expiring January 9, 2019, after which the project could be terminated. TD has made demand on the performance bond; however, Zurich Insurance, the project's surety, asserted that since TD had not asserted ""step in"" rights, the demand on the performance bond is considered a ""nullity."" The lenders have the option of asserting ""step-in"" rights but disagree they are obligated to exercise these rights, which may expose the lenders to greater liability.

Ontario Wealth Management Corporation (""OWMC""), a related entity to Owemanco had agreed to fund a $1.1MM construction loan to the property's owner, Mr. De Silva. The initial advance of funds occurred in August 2017, while the balance of the loan was to be advanced in stages to complete the construction project. However, after Owemanco's inspections in late 2017 revealed that little progress was being made on the construction of the house, it advised Mr. De Silva that no further advances would be made. After Mr. De Silva defaulted on the Owemanco mortgage in September 2018, Owemanco took possession of the property a month later, retaining a property manager and setting up hydro and gas accounts for the property. Currently, Mr. De Silva does not appear to have the equity or other financial means to advance construction of the house beyond its current state, which is about 80% complete. Because he is no longer in possession of the property, there is no construction occurring nor is the house listed for sale. The unfinished state of the house significantly reduces the pool of buyers available, further reducing the likelihood that Mr. De Silva will be able to sell the property in a timely manner. In addition to the Owemanco mortgage, there is a second mortgage and two certificates of pending litigation registered on title to the property. Owemanco is only prepared to proceed through a court-appointed receiver, as a receivership would permit clear title as well as simplify and unify in one proceeding the competing claims of subsequent encumbrancers relating to the property. Further, a receiver, as an officer of the court, is better positioned than the debtor, or Owemanco under a power of sale, to consider and make recommendations as to the disposition of any surplus proceeds. Rosen Goldberg was appointed receiver and will consider either expediting the sale of the property as is, or completing the construction of the property and selling it afterwards.

In June 2017, BMO was advised by the company's VP, Roopinder Bahl, and director, Jannette Saberon, that they had experienced a marital breakdown and separated. This discord allegedly impacted the business relationship between Mr. Bahl and the company's secretary, Varun Sharma, leading him to exit the active operation of the business. Ms. Saberon eventually took over operation of the gas station and pizza restaurant, but since she did not want to continue the business long-term, she put the property and business up for sale in early 2018. Compounding these issues is the opening of a new Esso gas station a kilometer away from the company's property. Given that Marmora is a small town and the Ultramar station is dependent on drive-by business, it is expected that the Esso station will negatively impact the company's earnings. msi Spergel was appointed receiver.

OpenHydro was managing the Cape Sharp Tidal Venture (CSTV), a tidal energy project located off Nova Scotia in the Minas Basin, an inlet of the Bay of Fundy. The CSTV is a joint venture of which OpenHydro’s parent company is the majority shareholder.

It is alleged, however, that the company was operating a far riskier mortgage investment business than the one represented to investors. Morteza Katebian and his son, Payam Katebian - the company's principals - are respondents in an enforcement proceeding before the OSC, in which it is alleged that they defrauded investors through misrepresentations contained in disclosure documents and committed other violations of Ontario securities law. In April 2017, the OSC obtained a temporary cease trade order, which is still in effect and which prevents the company from raising any more capital. The company later advised investors that it was winding down its operations; despite this announcement, however, the company continued to make loans and it is alleged that the principals diverted over $1.3MM in corporate funds for their personal benefit.

The company owns and operates a manufacturing facility in Richmond, British Columbia for processing organic waste (""Compost Facility""), as well as an electricity-producing anaerobic digestion facility (""Energy Garden""). Pursuant to agreements with various cities in the lower mainland, the company accepted organic and food waste materials from these cities for processing at its facility. In September 2016, Metro Vancouver issued an air quality management permit to the company containing requirements such as reducing the height of compost piles and replacing its composting system. Despite operating under this permit, the Compost Facility has been affected by odour complaints from neighbouring residents since 2016 and has been the subject of reporting by Vancouver media outlets. In response to these complaints, the Energy Garden eventually ceased operation in April 2017. This shut down resulted in the company being unable to meet its energy delivery obligations to the British Columbia Hydro and Power Authority (""BC Hydro"") under its agreement to sell BC Hydro certain quantities of renewable energy generated by the Energy Garden. BC Hydro advised that it would bill the company $12.5M in respect of the energy delivery shortfalls to date. The company cites further reasons for its financial difficulties, including, among other things, the fact that the company had to shut down one of its composting systems under the permit, which reduced the company's revenue.

Established in 1959, the Group comprises 12 entities and operates two large carpet-manufacturing and logistics facilities. The Group also has two business divisions: the manufacturing of broadloom carpets (""Broadloom Business""), which accounts for 46% of its revenues, and the distribution and sale of flooring products (""Flooring Business""), which accounts for 54%. Over the last five years, the Group has sustained substantial losses for several reasons. First, its performance was negatively impacted by the downturn in the carpet manufacturing industry due to a shift in consumer preferences to hard surface flooring and the availability of cheaper broadloom carpeting from China. Second, the Group faces significant fixed costs, including those associated with maintaining and operating its facilities. In March 2018, Hilco UK - the sole shareholder of Pinnacle Capital Resources, who is the general partner of Red Ash Capital Partners, the Group's junior secured creditor who is owed $100.0MM - engaged Deloitte Corporate Finance to assist the Group with marketing and sale of the Broadloom Business. However, due to its dire financial circumstances and the lack of a going concern transaction, the Broadloom Business ceased activity on September 8, affecting 256 workers. Florida-based QEP will acquire substantially all of the assets related to the Flooring Business.

For the past several years, the company has experienced annual losses exceeding $5.0MM. It attributes its financial difficulties to a downturn in the oil, gas and mining sectors, growing maintenance costs, and a global depression in the helicopter charter services market. Until recently, the company was solely owned by Discovery Air, which filed for protection under the CCAA in March, with $127.0MM of debt set to mature, including $93.0MM of secured debt that had been guaranteed by the company and other members of Discovery Air's Group. Discovery Air's assets and liabilities were eventually purchased in July by a company formed by its largest creditor, Clairvest Group. Currently, the company is in default of existing obligations under its secured guarantee in favour of Clairvest, owed $71.3MM. Together, they have been engaged for some time in efforts to restructure the company's business and operations to be viable on a long-term basis. However, due to the company's anticipated need for additional funding and Clairvest's unwillingness to provide such further funding, the company has concluded that a restructuring or sale of its business is best facilitated through CCAA proceedings. Because of the seasonality of the company's business - with most of its revenue earned in June to September - it will require significant funding until its next busy season.

The company, which was formed by a group of four radiologists, originally acquired the business from Life Labs. Shortly after the acquisition, the company began to suffer from severe and irreconcilable disagreements among shareholding groups and board members. In particular, there was a strong discord between the company's president, Dr. Jae Kim, and the other three radiologists. The company had made a number of cash advances to related entities that did not share the same ownership as the company but in which Dr. Kim held significant equity interests. Although Dr. Kim asserted that there were good business reasons for those advances, the other doctors did not accept his claim. By the summer of 2017, the company owed approximately $1.4MM to these related corporations, which subsequently affected the company's liquidity. With the cooperation of TD, the company attempted to commence an informal winding-up of its business operations by offering them up for sale. Although the lengthy sales process eventually resulted in an Agreement of Purchase of Sale dated April 2018, a specific condition was not met; as a result, the Agreement could not be completed and was terminated by the seller. The company's business is threatened unless it is able to promptly re-market its business and complete a sale. There is public interest in keeping the clinics open and operating during the sales process as they provide 40% or more of the Ontario public's access to MRI services outside of hospital operations.

Founded in 1972, the company has grown to employ over 1,100 workers and operates in over 35 countries. In recent years, however, it has suffered significant losses, due largely to several unprofitable contracts. In July 2017, the company engaged Deloitte as a financial advisor. On several occasions, Deloitte recommended that the company should, in light of its financial situation and liquidity issues, enter into an operational and financial restructuring. These recommendations were ignored by the company, which was more focused on the long-term perspective of total revenues vs. the profitability of contracts and its short-term critical issues. On August 22, 2018, Deloitte was made aware that the company was filing a motion to initiate proceedings under the CCAA, Despite its role with the company, Deloitte was never consulted with respect to the proposed CCAA restructuring plan. PwC was proposed to be the monitor. The company's main secured lenders, Alaris Royalty (“Alaris”) and Integrated Private Debt Fund V (“IPDF”), respectively owed $93.7MM and $25.8MM, were also not consulted. Alaris and IPDF (the ""Applicants"") immediately filed a joint application seeking the establishment of an alternative restructuring plan under the CCAA, arguing that the company's filing was in direct violation of the company's contractual obligations and was not made in good faith. The Applicants further allege that the company's proposed restructuring does not benefit the company's most important stakeholders but appears solely to serve the interests of the company's largest shareholder and former president, Bernard Poulin, who, according to the company, was removed from management following allegations of corruption.

Although the OpsMobil Group's primary assets are aircraft and aircraft support facilities, it has been focused on transitioning to value added services through its asset management solutions. By nature of its business, the OpsMobil Group's revenues are dependent on the expenditures of oil and gas producers, which have been depressed since 2014. In 2015, Third Eye Capital purchased the $5.3MM debt owed by OpsMobil to BMO for $3.8MM.

OpsMobil was able to negotiate and enter into a payment plan with the CRA for amounts owing at the time; however, it eventually missed the third payment and discovered that its line of credit had been restricted due to a lower than expected borrowing base calculation. As a result of the missed payment, CRA issued an enhanced garnishment of OpsMobil's revenue and accounts. Throughout early 2016, OpsMobil was continuously deprived of funds that were required for its daily operations due to its borrowing base restrictions and CRA's garnishment.
