# GIT ADD:  "add -A" (default), "add -u", "add .", and "add *"

# add -A: add all the changes in staging in the entire working tree (new, modified, deleted)
## Only wanna add the changes in a specified directory
git add -A my_dir/
## add every EXCEPT deleted files
git add --no-all my_dir/

# add -u (update): add all the MODIFIED and DELETED files BUT NOT untracked or new files for the entire tree
## only wanna update a specified directory
git add -u my_dir/

# add . is NOT THE SAME AS add -A: it DOES NOT add changes in the TOP LEVEL directory if you're in the subtree of the directory. hence, it DOES NOT ADD for the ENTIRE TREE like git add -A does

# NOT RECCOMEND: add * because it is a shell command, not sth that git knows how to use properly. Hence, it usually IGNORE deleted and hidden files when we try to add stuffs
